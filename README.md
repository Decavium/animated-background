# animated-background
A small CSS-driven animation inspired by friend's trip to Japan. Animated SVG elements pass behind a div with content, which should look like the landscape racing by as if you're looking through a window on a train. The SVGs also shake a little, as I tried to emulate the shake of a train whilst passaging on old tracks.
